IBCellFlipSegue
===============

*IBCellFlipSegue* is a simple custom segue meant to replicate the behavior of the buttons in the new version of the [Expedia Hotels & Flights](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expedia-hotels-flights/id427916203?mt=8) app. Currently, the segue is in it's very early stages of development, and it was created as a simple personal project which I have decided to share.
